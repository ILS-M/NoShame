    When I was 23 I became quite ill with my mental health (anxiety and depression). I had been suffering for years but it got to a point where I couldn’t carry on trying to ignore it. I got signed off work, ended up on different medications and
    found myself in counselling. In my professional life I was used to talking with people their mental health, supporting and sign posting people, I even lead Well Being sessions! However, when it came to looking after my own mental health,
    acknowledging it and talking about it, it was a completely different story. It has taken me years to come to terms with the illness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doing sport and finding the right support has helped me find ways to cope with the illness. When the doctor referred me to a counsellor it was a verrryyy long process (the waiting lists are painful) and taking anti-depressants was scary. There
    are so many barriers and hurdles when trying to get better, I wanted to do something about it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are suffering with your mental health it can be hard to motivate yourself to be active and can be intimidating going to a gym class or starting a new sports. Admitting you may need some support (whether that’s talking to a friend, going
    to the doctors or being kinder to yourself) can be terrifying. No Shame session’s aim to create a safe and inclusive environment so that you can be active. These are informal session with a friendly environment for all abilities. There is
    absolutely no expectation to talk about your story at these sessions but if you need someone to talk to there will be someone to listen*.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope this group will encourage people to realise that: </p>

  <p> There is
    <strong> NO SHAME </strong>in having a mental health illness. </p>
  <p>
    There is <strong>NO SHAME</strong> in being scared to talk about the illness.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is<strong>NO SHAME</strong> in feeling helpless or frustrated when trying to support someone with a mental health illness.
  </p>
